And as always, it's at the expense of those people who are in their way in the communities, in those particular sections of the geography of the space that we're in. When folks decide, \"Oh yeah, this is what we need. This is where we need to be.\" Then the question becomes, \"Okay, so how do we rewrite the story and get these folks out of the way, so that we can have our ultra-luxury city?\" You nailed it. And I think the thing that does bring some, I think joy and a bit of solace to me is the fact that I believe people learned a very valuable lesson from the South End and people being bought out and literally having property stole from under them, because the reality is, we don't see the blueprints, 40 years, 20 years, 10 years out. So we don't know where it's going. So, you think you're are getting a good deal when low and behold, it comes back and it becomes luxury property. So I am very thankful knowing that to some extent, I think that we've learned from that, to the extent that we can do something about it. It's a whole other story, but we've got young, progressive, savvy, young folks in our community now who are saying, \"No, this is my home. I'm staying, and this is how I'm going to shore this up.\" So it's important to me, I think looking at that and then figuring out my role in maintaining, sustaining, making certain that my young people are well equipped with, first and foremost, their history. They need to know what goes on, what happens, how things happen, how they transpire, and then I want to do my part to help to equip them and give them a head-start on protecting or creating. So that \"generational wealth\" is not a catchphrase that applies to other people. So I think that's where I am right now.",

And as always, it's at the expense of those people who are in their way in the communities, in those particular sections of the geography of the space that we're in. When folks decide, \"Oh yeah, this is what we need. This is where we need to be.\" Then the question becomes, \"Okay, so how do we rewrite the story and get these folks out of the way, so that we can have our ultra-luxury city?\" You nailed it. And I think the thing that does bring some, I think joy and a bit of solace to me is the fact that I believe people learned a very valuable lesson from the South End and people being bought out and literally having property stole from under them, because the reality is, we don't see the blueprints, 40 years, 20 years, 10 years out. So we don't know where it's going. So, you think you're are getting a good deal when low and behold, it comes back and it becomes luxury property. So I am very thankful knowing that to some extent, I think that we've learned from that, to the extent that we can do something about it. It's a whole other story, but we've got young, progressive, savvy, young folks in our community now who are saying, \"No, this is my home. I'm staying, and this is how I'm going to shore this up.\" So it's important to me, I think looking at that and then figuring out my role in maintaining, sustaining, making certain that my young people are well equipped with, first and foremost, their history. They need to know what goes on, what happens, how things happen, how they transpire, and then I want to do my part to help to equip them and give them a head-start on protecting or creating. So that \"generational wealth\" is not a catchphrase that applies to other people. So I think that's where I am right now.",

And as always, it's at the expense of those people who are in their way in the communities, in those particular sections of the geography of the space that we're in. When folks decide, \"Oh yeah, this is what we need. This is where we need to be.\" Then the question becomes, \"Okay, so how do we rewrite the story and get these folks out of the way, so that we can have our ultra-luxury city?\" You nailed it. And I think the thing that does bring some, I think joy and a bit of solace to me is the fact that I believe people learned a very valuable lesson from the South End and people being bought out and literally having property stole from under them, because the reality is, we don't see the blueprints, 40 years, 20 years, 10 years out. So we don't know where it's going. So, you think you're are getting a good deal when low and behold, it comes back and it becomes luxury property. So I am very thankful knowing that to some extent, I think that we've learned from that, to the extent that we can do something about it. It's a whole other story, but we've got young, progressive, savvy, young folks in our community now who are saying, \"No, this is my home. I'm staying, and this is how I'm going to shore this up.\" So it's important to me, I think looking at that and then figuring out my role in maintaining, sustaining, making certain that my young people are well equipped with, first and foremost, their history. They need to know what goes on, what happens, how things happen, how they transpire, and then I want to do my part to help to equip them and give them a head-start on protecting or creating. So that \"generational wealth\" is not a catchphrase that applies to other people. So I think that's where I am right now.",

We had a number of people come through the organization I work with, dealing with everything from anxiety to depression, self-harm, just a lot of different things that they've been wrestling with and often feeling that they don't have an outlet. A big theme that popped up for the teens I worked with this summer was dealing with family dynamics and oftentimes not feeling safe or heard in their own homes. And how can we provide resources for them to work through that? So for me, I'm really just thinking about, how can we create safe spaces for young people, teenagers, middle schoolers, high schoolers, to talk about what they're going through and then to get the help they need to deal with whatever it is that they're going through? And hopefully, I can play a part in that as well.",

We had a number of people come through the organization I work with, dealing with everything from anxiety to depression, self-harm, just a lot of different things that they've been wrestling with and often feeling that they don't have an outlet. A big theme that popped up for the teens I worked with this summer was dealing with family dynamics and oftentimes not feeling safe or heard in their own homes. And how can we provide resources for them to work through that? So for me, I'm really just thinking about, how can we create safe spaces for young people, teenagers, middle schoolers, high schoolers, to talk about what they're going through and then to get the help they need to deal with whatever it is that they're going through? And hopefully, I can play a part in that as well.",

So that there's a social worker, a tutor, or someone that knows how to play basketball or whatever. There's nothing around. When I was growing up, we had so many different centers where it was teaching us, keeping us off the street. We had different things that we could get into besides being on the streets. And there's no place for the kids to go to, to get any type of help. Like he said, \"Mental health, having problems at home with their parents.\" You used to be able to go to another parent and talk to that parent about what their child was going through. Now, the kids don't trust anyone. So I think we need more of something for them to do and get into. There's no music centers, everybody wants to rap, or sing, or... There's nothing for them to do. So what's the future for them? Where are they going to go? Where's their outlet? How do they get help? And I have a daughter that's 20 years old. She doesn't walk, or talk, she has cerebral palsy and I'm always looking for things to do and bring her to, so that it's like, \"Okay, I can put in my part, but then I'm also getting her out and doing something with her and showing the community that we do have all types of kids around.\"",

So that there's a social worker, a tutor, or someone that knows how to play basketball or whatever. There's nothing around. When I was growing up, we had so many different centers where it was teaching us, keeping us off the street. We had different things that we could get into besides being on the streets. And there's no place for the kids to go to, to get any type of help. Like he said, \"Mental health, having problems at home with their parents.\" You used to be able to go to another parent and talk to that parent about what their child was going through. Now, the kids don't trust anyone. So I think we need more of something for them to do and get into. There's no music centers, everybody wants to rap, or sing, or... There's nothing for them to do. So what's the future for them? Where are they going to go? Where's their outlet? How do they get help? And I have a daughter that's 20 years old. She doesn't walk, or talk, she has cerebral palsy and I'm always looking for things to do and bring her to, so that it's like, \"Okay, I can put in my part, but then I'm also getting her out and doing something with her and showing the community that we do have all types of kids around.\"",

They had parties for us, Halloween parties indoors. It was safe. My mom knew that I was going somewhere that was safe. Was a tutor up there. It was, things that they knew that we needed, they would find. And just, next thing you know, it was there. So we had somewhere to go. I had somewhere to go up until 10 o'clock at night. And my mom knew I was safe. It was right in Carmen Square. It wasn't far from the house. It was right on the bus route. I had somewhere to go and I knew that it was going to be fun. And I was looking forward to going there after school. I was going to see my friends. They had drawing there. They had different things there for us to do. And it was all up to us to pick and choose what we wanted to do. I didn't do a lot of stuff, but I had somewhere to go and stay out of trouble and not be just standing outside or just sitting on my porch doing nothing. So that's what got me to that question.",

It was, things that they knew that we needed, they would find. And just, next thing you know, it was there. So we had somewhere to go. I had somewhere to go up until 10 o'clock at night. And my mom knew I was safe. It was right in Carmen Square. It wasn't far from the house. It was right on the bus route. I had somewhere to go and I knew that it was going to be fun. And I was looking forward to going there after school. I was going to see my friends. They had drawing there. They had different things there for us to do. And it was all up to us to pick and choose what we wanted to do. I didn't do a lot of stuff, but I had somewhere to go and stay out of trouble and not be just standing outside or just sitting on my porch doing nothing. So that's what got me to that question.",

It talks about the programs and things that we had initiated, such as Healthy Boston, [inaudible] Street. I don't know if you were around at that time? With Healthy Boston, a developed program that was called Ties that Bind. What the purpose of that was, was to bring an intergenerational component to children that were latchkey, what have you. And we did things like put together whale-watch trips, going to the theater. We got donations from the different museums and things of that nature. Keep the children engaged, but also give them some guidance by participating in these different events with the older generation. But we've lost all those. Those were very successful programs. But I would say, if you want to see what was then back in the late eighties, early nineties and stuff, or what have you, This Ain't Normal would be a good show to watch. I know that they're streaming it on Showtime, YouTube, and other things. I don't know if anyone knows Dennis Wilson, but he's one of the [crosstalk]. And he is one of the co-producers of the show. Yeah, and you're absolutely right. There's not enough, very constructive and engaging things for children to do. I see that with my own grandchildren. I have to make these things happen. And with everybody, and being in such a financial slump and stuff, it's very difficult. But especially at this time, we need to start to rebuild these children so that they can have some hope and joy. Like have a childhood? Well, yes. Because the trauma and everything, and that they've experienced in the last year and a half... Seen a huge increase in the bullying, the meanness. So we have a lot of... Again, we have a lot of work to do. For me, this is like, excuse my expression, but, \"It's like shoveling shit against the tide.\" We were there in the eighties and the nineties with the drugs and all of that sort of stuff. But I know that things can change because it did. We just got to keep our foot on the pedal and make sure these services are there, especially for the children coming behind us.",

It talks about the programs and things that we had initiated, such as Healthy Boston, [inaudible] Street. I don't know if you were around at that time? With Healthy Boston, a developed program that was called Ties that Bind. What the purpose of that was, was to bring an intergenerational component to children that were latchkey, what have you. And we did things like put together whale-watch trips, going to the theater. We got donations from the different museums and things of that nature. Keep the children engaged, but also give them some guidance by participating in these different events with the older generation. But we've lost all those. Those were very successful programs. But I would say, if you want to see what was then back in the late eighties, early nineties and stuff, or what have you, This Ain't Normal would be a good show to watch. I know that they're streaming it on Showtime, YouTube, and other things. I don't know if anyone knows Dennis Wilson, but he's one of the [crosstalk]. And he is one of the co-producers of the show. Yeah, and you're absolutely right. There's not enough, very constructive and engaging things for children to do. I see that with my own grandchildren. I have to make these things happen. And with everybody, and being in such a financial slump and stuff, it's very difficult. But especially at this time, we need to start to rebuild these children so that they can have some hope and joy. Like have a childhood? Well, yes. Because the trauma and everything, and that they've experienced in the last year and a half... Seen a huge increase in the bullying, the meanness. So we have a lot of... Again, we have a lot of work to do. For me, this is like, excuse my expression, but, \"It's like shoveling shit against the tide.\" We were there in the eighties and the nineties with the drugs and all of that sort of stuff. But I know that things can change because it did. We just got to keep our foot on the pedal and make sure these services are there, especially for the children coming behind us.",

It talks about the programs and things that we had initiated, such as Healthy Boston, [inaudible] Street. I don't know if you were around at that time? With Healthy Boston, a developed program that was called Ties that Bind. What the purpose of that was, was to bring an intergenerational component to children that were latchkey, what have you. And we did things like put together whale-watch trips, going to the theater. We got donations from the different museums and things of that nature. Keep the children engaged, but also give them some guidance by participating in these different events with the older generation. But we've lost all those. Those were very successful programs. But I would say, if you want to see what was then back in the late eighties, early nineties and stuff, or what have you, This Ain't Normal would be a good show to watch. I know that they're streaming it on Showtime, YouTube, and other things. I don't know if anyone knows Dennis Wilson, but he's one of the [crosstalk]. And he is one of the co-producers of the show. Yeah, and you're absolutely right. There's not enough, very constructive and engaging things for children to do. I see that with my own grandchildren. I have to make these things happen. And with everybody, and being in such a financial slump and stuff, it's very difficult. But especially at this time, we need to start to rebuild these children so that they can have some hope and joy. Like have a childhood? Well, yes. Because the trauma and everything, and that they've experienced in the last year and a half... Seen a huge increase in the bullying, the meanness. So we have a lot of... Again, we have a lot of work to do. For me, this is like, excuse my expression, but, \"It's like shoveling shit against the tide.\" We were there in the eighties and the nineties with the drugs and all of that sort of stuff. But I know that things can change because it did. We just got to keep our foot on the pedal and make sure these services are there, especially for the children coming behind us.",

And I was born and grew up in the heart of the civil rights era. So I definitely have my own view and my own interpretation of things that I see and things that happen around me. And the one thing that my father was constantly working to drill and instill in us is to know and to understand who's at the table. And he was one of those people that, if there wasn't a table, he'd build one. And you don't leave people out. The best way to have a community conversation is to have everyone from the community. Those close by, even those folk who are far away, you include them in the conversation. And I look at where we are now on my street, on Brinsley street. We used to know everybody on our street. We used to know all of our neighbors. So when you talk about the kids having things to do and places to go, that wasn't so much an issue because all of our households had a hand in making that happen for kids. I can truthfully say to you now that I can't really walk out my front door and call anyone by name. My neighbor to my left has a lot of kids. And her kids call me neighbor, because I'll do stuff for them, I'll buy ice cream or treats or whatever, hand it to them. But they see me and they go, \"Hi neighbor.\" That's our life now. It used to be that we knew them, they knew us. We knew about each other. We knew how to help each other. It was more than just a casual wave to someone, \"Hey, how you're doing?\" So, that's missing. So now I think that in our community conversations... I think much like this call, it needs to be intergenerational. It's got to have Gail on the call, and I should be on the call and Marilyn should be there. We need Shamika and David to be there, to bring that perspective that oftentimes is beyond us because we are not thinking along that vein anymore. So we need to be cognizant of who's at the table, and then we need to make a concerted effort to make certain that if we're not there, we get them there. And if we need to, we need to build another table that's big enough to accommodate everybody so that we can all be a part of the conversation.",

And I was born and grew up in the heart of the civil rights era. So I definitely have my own view and my own interpretation of things that I see and things that happen around me. And the one thing that my father was constantly working to drill and instill in us is to know and to understand who's at the table. And he was one of those people that, if there wasn't a table, he'd build one. And you don't leave people out. The best way to have a community conversation is to have everyone from the community. Those close by, even those folk who are far away, you include them in the conversation. And I look at where we are now on my street, on Brinsley street. We used to know everybody on our street. We used to know all of our neighbors. So when you talk about the kids having things to do and places to go, that wasn't so much an issue because all of our households had a hand in making that happen for kids. I can truthfully say to you now that I can't really walk out my front door and call anyone by name. My neighbor to my left has a lot of kids. And her kids call me neighbor, because I'll do stuff for them, I'll buy ice cream or treats or whatever, hand it to them. But they see me and they go, \"Hi neighbor.\" That's our life now. It used to be that we knew them, they knew us. We knew about each other. We knew how to help each other. It was more than just a casual wave to someone, \"Hey, how you're doing?\" So, that's missing. So now I think that in our community conversations... I think much like this call, it needs to be intergenerational. It's got to have Gail on the call, and I should be on the call and Marilyn should be there. We need Shamika and David to be there, to bring that perspective that oftentimes is beyond us because we are not thinking along that vein anymore. So we need to be cognizant of who's at the table, and then we need to make a concerted effort to make certain that if we're not there, we get them there. And if we need to, we need to build another table that's big enough to accommodate everybody so that we can all be a part of the conversation.",

And I was born and grew up in the heart of the civil rights era. So I definitely have my own view and my own interpretation of things that I see and things that happen around me. And the one thing that my father was constantly working to drill and instill in us is to know and to understand who's at the table. And he was one of those people that, if there wasn't a table, he'd build one. And you don't leave people out. The best way to have a community conversation is to have everyone from the community. Those close by, even those folk who are far away, you include them in the conversation. And I look at where we are now on my street, on Brinsley street. We used to know everybody on our street. We used to know all of our neighbors. So when you talk about the kids having things to do and places to go, that wasn't so much an issue because all of our households had a hand in making that happen for kids. I can truthfully say to you now that I can't really walk out my front door and call anyone by name. My neighbor to my left has a lot of kids. And her kids call me neighbor, because I'll do stuff for them, I'll buy ice cream or treats or whatever, hand it to them. But they see me and they go, \"Hi neighbor.\" That's our life now. It used to be that we knew them, they knew us. We knew about each other. We knew how to help each other. It was more than just a casual wave to someone, \"Hey, how you're doing?\" So, that's missing. So now I think that in our community conversations... I think much like this call, it needs to be intergenerational. It's got to have Gail on the call, and I should be on the call and Marilyn should be there. We need Shamika and David to be there, to bring that perspective that oftentimes is beyond us because we are not thinking along that vein anymore. So we need to be cognizant of who's at the table, and then we need to make a concerted effort to make certain that if we're not there, we get them there. And if we need to, we need to build another table that's big enough to accommodate everybody so that we can all be a part of the conversation.",

I've been working in one regard, the other with young people for the last 10 years and just doing life with them, spending time with them, mentoring, hanging out, just seeing this consistent theme of young people, especially brown and black young people, not feeling like they have anywhere to go when stuff is going wrong around them. And when they're facing a trial or something, or trauma or whatever it may be. So many times it's either they turn to their peers or they're keeping it in, or unfortunately, turn into other things to try and fill that void. And so I spent a lot of time working with young people in the context of the church. And so, a lot of it is spiritual-based, but as I grew older, I just really felt this need of, \"We can do more for these young people, than have them for two hours at a church service on a Friday night.\" And so for me, it was just very looking for, \"How do I find a holistic way to be of service to young people, to see them get access to more than just mental health resources, but healthier food, education?\" And even this past summer, I encountered so many kids who just legitimately so intelligent, so smart. Even more than me, but [inaudible] for them, they don't want to go to school, they don't want to take classes, but it's so... Just tension of seeing the brilliance in them, that the things that they're passionate about, they're so gifted in, but then just having no desire to apply to the certain areas in school, or you even just like... Sometimes high school is just the end. They're like, \"Let me just... I'll finish high school and then whatever happens, happens.\" And oftentimes there's not this... They don't often see that path or that way forward. And I think Shamika, you mentioned something earlier about, or maybe I can't remember it was [inaudible], helping these kids finding that hope again. And so being able to say, \"Hey, there is actually a path forward for me to success.\" And, yes, if that's [inaudible], but success doesn't have to be limited to getting a bachelor's. Especially in 2021, there are so many different ways that you can find success and make money and be happy and achieve all those goals. So it's really trying to find ways that these teens can actually envision a future. And it did surprise me this summer by hearing just how many of our teens didn't have that plan or even have that thought. And so hoping that in these conversations, and as we elevate more voices and elevate more youth voices, that we can start to bring back some of those things and some of those programs that show our kids and show our community in general, that there is a path forward, there is a way forward. And so that's just really where I'm at and how I've gotten here.",

I've been working in one regard, the other with young people for the last 10 years and just doing life with them, spending time with them, mentoring, hanging out, just seeing this consistent theme of young people, especially brown and black young people, not feeling like they have anywhere to go when stuff is going wrong around them. And when they're facing a trial or something, or trauma or whatever it may be. So many times it's either they turn to their peers or they're keeping it in, or unfortunately, turn into other things to try and fill that void. And so I spent a lot of time working with young people in the context of the church. And so, a lot of it is spiritual-based, but as I grew older, I just really felt this need of, \"We can do more for these young people, than have them for two hours at a church service on a Friday night.\" And so for me, it was just very looking for, \"How do I find a holistic way to be of service to young people, to see them get access to more than just mental health resources, but healthier food, education?\" And even this past summer, I encountered so many kids who just legitimately so intelligent, so smart. Even more than me, but [inaudible] for them, they don't want to go to school, they don't want to take classes, but it's so... Just tension of seeing the brilliance in them, that the things that they're passionate about, they're so gifted in, but then just having no desire to apply to the certain areas in school, or you even just like... Sometimes high school is just the end. They're like, \"Let me just... I'll finish high school and then whatever happens, happens.\" And oftentimes there's not this... They don't often see that path or that way forward. And I think Shamika, you mentioned something earlier about, or maybe I can't remember it was [inaudible], helping these kids finding that hope again. And so being able to say, \"Hey, there is actually a path forward for me to success.\" And, yes, if that's [inaudible], but success doesn't have to be limited to getting a bachelor's. Especially in 2021, there are so many different ways that you can find success and make money and be happy and achieve all those goals. So it's really trying to find ways that these teens can actually envision a future. And it did surprise me this summer by hearing just how many of our teens didn't have that plan or even have that thought. And so hoping that in these conversations, and as we elevate more voices and elevate more youth voices, that we can start to bring back some of those things and some of those programs that show our kids and show our community in general, that there is a path forward, there is a way forward. And so that's just really where I'm at and how I've gotten here.",

I've been working in one regard, the other with young people for the last 10 years and just doing life with them, spending time with them, mentoring, hanging out, just seeing this consistent theme of young people, especially brown and black young people, not feeling like they have anywhere to go when stuff is going wrong around them. And when they're facing a trial or something, or trauma or whatever it may be. So many times it's either they turn to their peers or they're keeping it in, or unfortunately, turn into other things to try and fill that void. And so I spent a lot of time working with young people in the context of the church. And so, a lot of it is spiritual-based, but as I grew older, I just really felt this need of, \"We can do more for these young people, than have them for two hours at a church service on a Friday night.\" And so for me, it was just very looking for, \"How do I find a holistic way to be of service to young people, to see them get access to more than just mental health resources, but healthier food, education?\" And even this past summer, I encountered so many kids who just legitimately so intelligent, so smart. Even more than me, but [inaudible] for them, they don't want to go to school, they don't want to take classes, but it's so... Just tension of seeing the brilliance in them, that the things that they're passionate about, they're so gifted in, but then just having no desire to apply to the certain areas in school, or you even just like... Sometimes high school is just the end. They're like, \"Let me just... I'll finish high school and then whatever happens, happens.\" And oftentimes there's not this... They don't often see that path or that way forward. And I think Shamika, you mentioned something earlier about, or maybe I can't remember it was [inaudible], helping these kids finding that hope again. And so being able to say, \"Hey, there is actually a path forward for me to success.\" And, yes, if that's [inaudible], but success doesn't have to be limited to getting a bachelor's. Especially in 2021, there are so many different ways that you can find success and make money and be happy and achieve all those goals. So it's really trying to find ways that these teens can actually envision a future. And it did surprise me this summer by hearing just how many of our teens didn't have that plan or even have that thought. And so hoping that in these conversations, and as we elevate more voices and elevate more youth voices, that we can start to bring back some of those things and some of those programs that show our kids and show our community in general, that there is a path forward, there is a way forward. And so that's just really where I'm at and how I've gotten here.",

I've been working in one regard, the other with young people for the last 10 years and just doing life with them, spending time with them, mentoring, hanging out, just seeing this consistent theme of young people, especially brown and black young people, not feeling like they have anywhere to go when stuff is going wrong around them. And when they're facing a trial or something, or trauma or whatever it may be. So many times it's either they turn to their peers or they're keeping it in, or unfortunately, turn into other things to try and fill that void. And so I spent a lot of time working with young people in the context of the church. And so, a lot of it is spiritual-based, but as I grew older, I just really felt this need of, \"We can do more for these young people, than have them for two hours at a church service on a Friday night.\" And so for me, it was just very looking for, \"How do I find a holistic way to be of service to young people, to see them get access to more than just mental health resources, but healthier food, education?\" And even this past summer, I encountered so many kids who just legitimately so intelligent, so smart. Even more than me, but [inaudible] for them, they don't want to go to school, they don't want to take classes, but it's so... Just tension of seeing the brilliance in them, that the things that they're passionate about, they're so gifted in, but then just having no desire to apply to the certain areas in school, or you even just like... Sometimes high school is just the end. They're like, \"Let me just... I'll finish high school and then whatever happens, happens.\" And oftentimes there's not this... They don't often see that path or that way forward. And I think Shamika, you mentioned something earlier about, or maybe I can't remember it was [inaudible], helping these kids finding that hope again. And so being able to say, \"Hey, there is actually a path forward for me to success.\" And, yes, if that's [inaudible], but success doesn't have to be limited to getting a bachelor's. Especially in 2021, there are so many different ways that you can find success and make money and be happy and achieve all those goals. So it's really trying to find ways that these teens can actually envision a future. And it did surprise me this summer by hearing just how many of our teens didn't have that plan or even have that thought. And so hoping that in these conversations, and as we elevate more voices and elevate more youth voices, that we can start to bring back some of those things and some of those programs that show our kids and show our community in general, that there is a path forward, there is a way forward. And so that's just really where I'm at and how I've gotten here.",
