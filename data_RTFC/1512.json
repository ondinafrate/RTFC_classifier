And my success rate has been based on the mentors and the resources that I've had all my life that I've been able to pull on and grasp when I've needed them. So, an example of that from a very young age, and I'm speaking from about eight to 12, that really started to guide me into the best directions. Let me also give you a background. No father figure, no uncles, no older brothers. So no real great example of what a male should be and what males need to be doing. So, I would say, the first program was the Paul Robeson Institute and they were located where Ruggles is, so is T accessible. And I won't get in too deep in that. It was an awesome program. It was every Saturday, but you had mentorship and you had apprenticeship. So you could do shop, you could do fashion, you can do whatever it may be and you had an experience. You also walked away with the projects, so is a project based program and everybody in there, I still interact with on certain levels. Keith Motley was one of the head organizers. I think he was at UMass last, I don't know what's going on with brother Motley but that's what I'm saying. You still have brother Motley doing a lot of things throughout the city of Boston, and I can pick up the phone and call him. I have people like you from the Chica Project. We need more catalysts like that and that is the reason why I've been able to be successful, and I am currently the operations manager for Zuma Boston in the Four Seasons Dalton like you can't do that. Those opportunities doesn't happen for people like me where I'm from. And it's really because I'm a product of my environment that has encouraged me and enabled me to be the best that I am and give the best to the people around me.",

And my success rate has been based on the mentors and the resources that I've had all my life that I've been able to pull on and grasp when I've needed them. So, an example of that from a very young age, and I'm speaking from about eight to 12, that really started to guide me into the best directions. Let me also give you a background. No father figure, no uncles, no older brothers. So no real great example of what a male should be and what males need to be doing. So, I would say, the first program was the Paul Robeson Institute and they were located where Ruggles is, so is T accessible. And I won't get in too deep in that. It was an awesome program. It was every Saturday, but you had mentorship and you had apprenticeship. So you could do shop, you could do fashion, you can do whatever it may be and you had an experience. You also walked away with the projects, so is a project based program and everybody in there, I still interact with on certain levels. Keith Motley was one of the head organizers. I think he was at UMass last, I don't know what's going on with brother Motley but that's what I'm saying. You still have brother Motley doing a lot of things throughout the city of Boston, and I can pick up the phone and call him. I have people like you from the Chica Project. We need more catalysts like that and that is the reason why I've been able to be successful, and I am currently the operations manager for Zuma Boston in the Four Seasons Dalton like you can't do that. Those opportunities doesn't happen for people like me where I'm from. And it's really because I'm a product of my environment that has encouraged me and enabled me to be the best that I am and give the best to the people around me.",

And my success rate has been based on the mentors and the resources that I've had all my life that I've been able to pull on and grasp when I've needed them. So, an example of that from a very young age, and I'm speaking from about eight to 12, that really started to guide me into the best directions. Let me also give you a background. No father figure, no uncles, no older brothers. So no real great example of what a male should be and what males need to be doing. So, I would say, the first program was the Paul Robeson Institute and they were located where Ruggles is, so is T accessible. And I won't get in too deep in that. It was an awesome program. It was every Saturday, but you had mentorship and you had apprenticeship. So you could do shop, you could do fashion, you can do whatever it may be and you had an experience. You also walked away with the projects, so is a project based program and everybody in there, I still interact with on certain levels. Keith Motley was one of the head organizers. I think he was at UMass last, I don't know what's going on with brother Motley but that's what I'm saying. You still have brother Motley doing a lot of things throughout the city of Boston, and I can pick up the phone and call him. I have people like you from the Chica Project. We need more catalysts like that and that is the reason why I've been able to be successful, and I am currently the operations manager for Zuma Boston in the Four Seasons Dalton like you can't do that. Those opportunities doesn't happen for people like me where I'm from. And it's really because I'm a product of my environment that has encouraged me and enabled me to be the best that I am and give the best to the people around me.",

And my success rate has been based on the mentors and the resources that I've had all my life that I've been able to pull on and grasp when I've needed them. So, an example of that from a very young age, and I'm speaking from about eight to 12, that really started to guide me into the best directions. Let me also give you a background. No father figure, no uncles, no older brothers. So no real great example of what a male should be and what males need to be doing. So, I would say, the first program was the Paul Robeson Institute and they were located where Ruggles is, so is T accessible. And I won't get in too deep in that. It was an awesome program. It was every Saturday, but you had mentorship and you had apprenticeship. So you could do shop, you could do fashion, you can do whatever it may be and you had an experience. You also walked away with the projects, so is a project based program and everybody in there, I still interact with on certain levels. Keith Motley was one of the head organizers. I think he was at UMass last, I don't know what's going on with brother Motley but that's what I'm saying. You still have brother Motley doing a lot of things throughout the city of Boston, and I can pick up the phone and call him. I have people like you from the Chica Project. We need more catalysts like that and that is the reason why I've been able to be successful, and I am currently the operations manager for Zuma Boston in the Four Seasons Dalton like you can't do that. Those opportunities doesn't happen for people like me where I'm from. And it's really because I'm a product of my environment that has encouraged me and enabled me to be the best that I am and give the best to the people around me.",

And my success rate has been based on the mentors and the resources that I've had all my life that I've been able to pull on and grasp when I've needed them. So, an example of that from a very young age, and I'm speaking from about eight to 12, that really started to guide me into the best directions. Let me also give you a background. No father figure, no uncles, no older brothers. So no real great example of what a male should be and what males need to be doing. So, I would say, the first program was the Paul Robeson Institute and they were located where Ruggles is, so is T accessible. And I won't get in too deep in that. It was an awesome program. It was every Saturday, but you had mentorship and you had apprenticeship. So you could do shop, you could do fashion, you can do whatever it may be and you had an experience. You also walked away with the projects, so is a project based program and everybody in there, I still interact with on certain levels. Keith Motley was one of the head organizers. I think he was at UMass last, I don't know what's going on with brother Motley but that's what I'm saying. You still have brother Motley doing a lot of things throughout the city of Boston, and I can pick up the phone and call him. I have people like you from the Chica Project. We need more catalysts like that and that is the reason why I've been able to be successful, and I am currently the operations manager for Zuma Boston in the Four Seasons Dalton like you can't do that. Those opportunities doesn't happen for people like me where I'm from. And it's really because I'm a product of my environment that has encouraged me and enabled me to be the best that I am and give the best to the people around me.",

I've been very fortunate to be one of the very few black people that have been able to attend to the best university in the world, MIT and Harvard. And at every one of those scenarios, I've been always questioning, why am I the only one? Then I look at Roxbury and Dorchester, and I do see that there are black people there And just to give you some context, an Africa Latin American. So I was born in South America, but I've been in the US for many years and I've lived in different cities in the US. But then like I said, Boston reproduces these racial hierarchy to certain degree and extension. And then when you have a city that has like the top two universities in the world, and then you see that there are black people that actually helped build this country and they don't get to enjoy the benefit, is such a contradiction. And then you see people from all over the world coming to Harvard, MIT and then you see all these institutions talking about diversity and inclusion and they are talking about gender diversity, nationality diversity, but nobody really seems to care about racial diversity specifically, the absence of black people. So, that's what I'm talking about.",

I've been very fortunate to be one of the very few black people that have been able to attend to the best university in the world, MIT and Harvard. And at every one of those scenarios, I've been always questioning, why am I the only one? Then I look at Roxbury and Dorchester, and I do see that there are black people there And just to give you some context, an Africa Latin American. So I was born in South America, but I've been in the US for many years and I've lived in different cities in the US. But then like I said, Boston reproduces these racial hierarchy to certain degree and extension. And then when you have a city that has like the top two universities in the world, and then you see that there are black people that actually helped build this country and they don't get to enjoy the benefit, is such a contradiction. And then you see people from all over the world coming to Harvard, MIT and then you see all these institutions talking about diversity and inclusion and they are talking about gender diversity, nationality diversity, but nobody really seems to care about racial diversity specifically, the absence of black people. So, that's what I'm talking about.",

I've been very fortunate to be one of the very few black people that have been able to attend to the best university in the world, MIT and Harvard. And at every one of those scenarios, I've been always questioning, why am I the only one? Then I look at Roxbury and Dorchester, and I do see that there are black people there And just to give you some context, an Africa Latin American. So I was born in South America, but I've been in the US for many years and I've lived in different cities in the US. But then like I said, Boston reproduces these racial hierarchy to certain degree and extension. And then when you have a city that has like the top two universities in the world, and then you see that there are black people that actually helped build this country and they don't get to enjoy the benefit, is such a contradiction. And then you see people from all over the world coming to Harvard, MIT and then you see all these institutions talking about diversity and inclusion and they are talking about gender diversity, nationality diversity, but nobody really seems to care about racial diversity specifically, the absence of black people. So, that's what I'm talking about.",

So, I haven't been back to the Y except for a very hot day swimming. So anyway, when I walk around, I see so much that we spend protecting ourselves from each other. That's all the fences, and grates, and the police, and cameras, and alarms and all the barriers that we use to protect ourselves and I'm wondering, how can we pull those resources that we currently spend protecting ourselves from each other, to help us all to thrive? I'm sure that when you put all those things together, there's enough to house everyone, educate everyone, provide the transportation we need and the medical care we need iff we can pull those protective resources.",

But anyway, I grew up in Vermont where, in my high school, that was the first time I was in school with an African-American person in high school. And then there were three people of color in my whole high school and they were the same family. One of their name was Washington and they weren't in my class, of course, but I come from a long line of New England- You cut off. You're off. You put mute by mistake. You said you come from a long line of? Of Quakers, New England people. So clearly my philosophy, having come of age in the time of the civil rights like, oh, I didn't know that was a problem, but of course yeah, everybody's equal. I mean, I don't know any people who are different from me, but yeah that makes sense. So I didn't really have that real life experience. Of course, my ancestors are privileged and therefore, we know that they've benefited from slavery and all those things, but I didn't know anything about that, so you could call me innocent I suppose in the naive sense of the word. But now, of course, I've been here, I've been in Boston since 1972. That's a long time and I have a lot of experience. So this afternoon when I was out walking, I should say I live maybe a half mile from Nubian Square and so, I walked out bound toward Nubian Square through Nubian square, and then kept going. So, I did a big loop going down Blue Hill Avenue coming back on Warren Avenue, and I see lots of people and many of those people are averting their eyes when they get close. There's no good afternoon, and I kind of understand that's because of the racial difference and it's just very sad because I certainly would like to connect and yet I have to tune into a conversation like this to do that.",

But anyway, I grew up in Vermont where, in my high school, that was the first time I was in school with an African-American person in high school. And then there were three people of color in my whole high school and they were the same family. One of their name was Washington and they weren't in my class, of course, but I come from a long line of New England- You cut off. You're off. You put mute by mistake. You said you come from a long line of? Of Quakers, New England people. So clearly my philosophy, having come of age in the time of the civil rights like, oh, I didn't know that was a problem, but of course yeah, everybody's equal. I mean, I don't know any people who are different from me, but yeah that makes sense. So I didn't really have that real life experience. Of course, my ancestors are privileged and therefore, we know that they've benefited from slavery and all those things, but I didn't know anything about that, so you could call me innocent I suppose in the naive sense of the word. But now, of course, I've been here, I've been in Boston since 1972. That's a long time and I have a lot of experience. So this afternoon when I was out walking, I should say I live maybe a half mile from Nubian Square and so, I walked out bound toward Nubian Square through Nubian square, and then kept going. So, I did a big loop going down Blue Hill Avenue coming back on Warren Avenue, and I see lots of people and many of those people are averting their eyes when they get close. There's no good afternoon, and I kind of understand that's because of the racial difference and it's just very sad because I certainly would like to connect and yet I have to tune into a conversation like this to do that.",

But anyway, I grew up in Vermont where, in my high school, that was the first time I was in school with an African-American person in high school. And then there were three people of color in my whole high school and they were the same family. One of their name was Washington and they weren't in my class, of course, but I come from a long line of New England- You cut off. You're off. You put mute by mistake. You said you come from a long line of? Of Quakers, New England people. So clearly my philosophy, having come of age in the time of the civil rights like, oh, I didn't know that was a problem, but of course yeah, everybody's equal. I mean, I don't know any people who are different from me, but yeah that makes sense. So I didn't really have that real life experience. Of course, my ancestors are privileged and therefore, we know that they've benefited from slavery and all those things, but I didn't know anything about that, so you could call me innocent I suppose in the naive sense of the word. But now, of course, I've been here, I've been in Boston since 1972. That's a long time and I have a lot of experience. So this afternoon when I was out walking, I should say I live maybe a half mile from Nubian Square and so, I walked out bound toward Nubian Square through Nubian square, and then kept going. So, I did a big loop going down Blue Hill Avenue coming back on Warren Avenue, and I see lots of people and many of those people are averting their eyes when they get close. There's no good afternoon, and I kind of understand that's because of the racial difference and it's just very sad because I certainly would like to connect and yet I have to tune into a conversation like this to do that.",

But anyway, I grew up in Vermont where, in my high school, that was the first time I was in school with an African-American person in high school. And then there were three people of color in my whole high school and they were the same family. One of their name was Washington and they weren't in my class, of course, but I come from a long line of New England- You cut off. You're off. You put mute by mistake. You said you come from a long line of? Of Quakers, New England people. So clearly my philosophy, having come of age in the time of the civil rights like, oh, I didn't know that was a problem, but of course yeah, everybody's equal. I mean, I don't know any people who are different from me, but yeah that makes sense. So I didn't really have that real life experience. Of course, my ancestors are privileged and therefore, we know that they've benefited from slavery and all those things, but I didn't know anything about that, so you could call me innocent I suppose in the naive sense of the word. But now, of course, I've been here, I've been in Boston since 1972. That's a long time and I have a lot of experience. So this afternoon when I was out walking, I should say I live maybe a half mile from Nubian Square and so, I walked out bound toward Nubian Square through Nubian square, and then kept going. So, I did a big loop going down Blue Hill Avenue coming back on Warren Avenue, and I see lots of people and many of those people are averting their eyes when they get close. There's no good afternoon, and I kind of understand that's because of the racial difference and it's just very sad because I certainly would like to connect and yet I have to tune into a conversation like this to do that.",

But anyway, I grew up in Vermont where, in my high school, that was the first time I was in school with an African-American person in high school. And then there were three people of color in my whole high school and they were the same family. One of their name was Washington and they weren't in my class, of course, but I come from a long line of New England- You cut off. You're off. You put mute by mistake. You said you come from a long line of? Of Quakers, New England people. So clearly my philosophy, having come of age in the time of the civil rights like, oh, I didn't know that was a problem, but of course yeah, everybody's equal. I mean, I don't know any people who are different from me, but yeah that makes sense. So I didn't really have that real life experience. Of course, my ancestors are privileged and therefore, we know that they've benefited from slavery and all those things, but I didn't know anything about that, so you could call me innocent I suppose in the naive sense of the word. But now, of course, I've been here, I've been in Boston since 1972. That's a long time and I have a lot of experience. So this afternoon when I was out walking, I should say I live maybe a half mile from Nubian Square and so, I walked out bound toward Nubian Square through Nubian square, and then kept going. So, I did a big loop going down Blue Hill Avenue coming back on Warren Avenue, and I see lots of people and many of those people are averting their eyes when they get close. There's no good afternoon, and I kind of understand that's because of the racial difference and it's just very sad because I certainly would like to connect and yet I have to tune into a conversation like this to do that.",

But anyway, I grew up in Vermont where, in my high school, that was the first time I was in school with an African-American person in high school. And then there were three people of color in my whole high school and they were the same family. One of their name was Washington and they weren't in my class, of course, but I come from a long line of New England- You cut off. You're off. You put mute by mistake. You said you come from a long line of? Of Quakers, New England people. So clearly my philosophy, having come of age in the time of the civil rights like, oh, I didn't know that was a problem, but of course yeah, everybody's equal. I mean, I don't know any people who are different from me, but yeah that makes sense. So I didn't really have that real life experience. Of course, my ancestors are privileged and therefore, we know that they've benefited from slavery and all those things, but I didn't know anything about that, so you could call me innocent I suppose in the naive sense of the word. But now, of course, I've been here, I've been in Boston since 1972. That's a long time and I have a lot of experience. So this afternoon when I was out walking, I should say I live maybe a half mile from Nubian Square and so, I walked out bound toward Nubian Square through Nubian square, and then kept going. So, I did a big loop going down Blue Hill Avenue coming back on Warren Avenue, and I see lots of people and many of those people are averting their eyes when they get close. There's no good afternoon, and I kind of understand that's because of the racial difference and it's just very sad because I certainly would like to connect and yet I have to tune into a conversation like this to do that.",

I guess what led me to that is, I grew up in Boston. I came here from Puerto Rico when I was three years old and I didn't know. I didn't know how to balance a checkbook. I didn't know what I didn't know, and no one showed me and I made a lot of mistakes financially. So now growing up, learning from my mistakes and a better place but right through a lot of bumps and hurdles, how do we teach our youth some of these things that other kids are taught from the beginning, so that they are in a better place to succeed. So when you talk about financial literacy, you're talking about balancing a checkbook, you're talking about your credit score, you're talking about saving money. All of these things that have an impact. You need these things in order to progress, in order to grow and in order to have some of these things that you want in life. So, what is Boston preparing? What are they going to do?",

I guess what led me to that is, I grew up in Boston. I came here from Puerto Rico when I was three years old and I didn't know. I didn't know how to balance a checkbook. I didn't know what I didn't know, and no one showed me and I made a lot of mistakes financially. So now growing up, learning from my mistakes and a better place but right through a lot of bumps and hurdles, how do we teach our youth some of these things that other kids are taught from the beginning, so that they are in a better place to succeed. So when you talk about financial literacy, you're talking about balancing a checkbook, you're talking about your credit score, you're talking about saving money. All of these things that have an impact. You need these things in order to progress, in order to grow and in order to have some of these things that you want in life. So, what is Boston preparing? What are they going to do?",

I guess what led me to that is, I grew up in Boston. I came here from Puerto Rico when I was three years old and I didn't know. I didn't know how to balance a checkbook. I didn't know what I didn't know, and no one showed me and I made a lot of mistakes financially. So now growing up, learning from my mistakes and a better place but right through a lot of bumps and hurdles, how do we teach our youth some of these things that other kids are taught from the beginning, so that they are in a better place to succeed. So when you talk about financial literacy, you're talking about balancing a checkbook, you're talking about your credit score, you're talking about saving money. All of these things that have an impact. You need these things in order to progress, in order to grow and in order to have some of these things that you want in life. So, what is Boston preparing? What are they going to do?",

I initially approached this film more like, okay it's a political film, but my strength is making personal films. So now I'm looking at Boston personally, because, even though I'm from New York City, I feel like Boston is the city that can set an example for the rest of the United States. Racism is throughout the United States. I'm an advocate for education and it's a huge disappointment to come to Boston, which I feel is the city of education and across the river is Harvard and MIT and like a two or three stops on a train, you're in Boston and I'm hearing about children in schools that are crumbling are afraid to go to the restroom and then forget about the pandemic. So I don't want to go on about it because it just gets me so angry. But I am all about education and I'm really happy that this program is happening because we really need to listen and find the people that are afraid to speak because I believe those are the people that, maybe they're fearful, but I believe those are the people that have the answers and maybe they're not courageous or they're afraid to step forward, but I believe with programs like this, it might give them an opportunity to speak. And if any of these mayors or government officials are smart, they should start listening. From the middle school child up into the seniors that are also being ignored. So, that's my two cents. So I really hope Boston changes. Between the pandemic and the murder of George Floyd, these are big wake-up calls and from this point forward there's no excuse for us to make, not only Boston, but the rest of the United States, just a better place and set an example globally.",

I initially approached this film more like, okay it's a political film, but my strength is making personal films. So now I'm looking at Boston personally, because, even though I'm from New York City, I feel like Boston is the city that can set an example for the rest of the United States. Racism is throughout the United States. I'm an advocate for education and it's a huge disappointment to come to Boston, which I feel is the city of education and across the river is Harvard and MIT and like a two or three stops on a train, you're in Boston and I'm hearing about children in schools that are crumbling are afraid to go to the restroom and then forget about the pandemic. So I don't want to go on about it because it just gets me so angry. But I am all about education and I'm really happy that this program is happening because we really need to listen and find the people that are afraid to speak because I believe those are the people that, maybe they're fearful, but I believe those are the people that have the answers and maybe they're not courageous or they're afraid to step forward, but I believe with programs like this, it might give them an opportunity to speak. And if any of these mayors or government officials are smart, they should start listening. From the middle school child up into the seniors that are also being ignored. So, that's my two cents. So I really hope Boston changes. Between the pandemic and the murder of George Floyd, these are big wake-up calls and from this point forward there's no excuse for us to make, not only Boston, but the rest of the United States, just a better place and set an example globally.",

I initially approached this film more like, okay it's a political film, but my strength is making personal films. So now I'm looking at Boston personally, because, even though I'm from New York City, I feel like Boston is the city that can set an example for the rest of the United States. Racism is throughout the United States. I'm an advocate for education and it's a huge disappointment to come to Boston, which I feel is the city of education and across the river is Harvard and MIT and like a two or three stops on a train, you're in Boston and I'm hearing about children in schools that are crumbling are afraid to go to the restroom and then forget about the pandemic. So I don't want to go on about it because it just gets me so angry. But I am all about education and I'm really happy that this program is happening because we really need to listen and find the people that are afraid to speak because I believe those are the people that, maybe they're fearful, but I believe those are the people that have the answers and maybe they're not courageous or they're afraid to step forward, but I believe with programs like this, it might give them an opportunity to speak. And if any of these mayors or government officials are smart, they should start listening. From the middle school child up into the seniors that are also being ignored. So, that's my two cents. So I really hope Boston changes. Between the pandemic and the murder of George Floyd, these are big wake-up calls and from this point forward there's no excuse for us to make, not only Boston, but the rest of the United States, just a better place and set an example globally.",

I initially approached this film more like, okay it's a political film, but my strength is making personal films. So now I'm looking at Boston personally, because, even though I'm from New York City, I feel like Boston is the city that can set an example for the rest of the United States. Racism is throughout the United States. I'm an advocate for education and it's a huge disappointment to come to Boston, which I feel is the city of education and across the river is Harvard and MIT and like a two or three stops on a train, you're in Boston and I'm hearing about children in schools that are crumbling are afraid to go to the restroom and then forget about the pandemic. So I don't want to go on about it because it just gets me so angry. But I am all about education and I'm really happy that this program is happening because we really need to listen and find the people that are afraid to speak because I believe those are the people that, maybe they're fearful, but I believe those are the people that have the answers and maybe they're not courageous or they're afraid to step forward, but I believe with programs like this, it might give them an opportunity to speak. And if any of these mayors or government officials are smart, they should start listening. From the middle school child up into the seniors that are also being ignored. So, that's my two cents. So I really hope Boston changes. Between the pandemic and the murder of George Floyd, these are big wake-up calls and from this point forward there's no excuse for us to make, not only Boston, but the rest of the United States, just a better place and set an example globally.",

I initially approached this film more like, okay it's a political film, but my strength is making personal films. So now I'm looking at Boston personally, because, even though I'm from New York City, I feel like Boston is the city that can set an example for the rest of the United States. Racism is throughout the United States. I'm an advocate for education and it's a huge disappointment to come to Boston, which I feel is the city of education and across the river is Harvard and MIT and like a two or three stops on a train, you're in Boston and I'm hearing about children in schools that are crumbling are afraid to go to the restroom and then forget about the pandemic. So I don't want to go on about it because it just gets me so angry. But I am all about education and I'm really happy that this program is happening because we really need to listen and find the people that are afraid to speak because I believe those are the people that, maybe they're fearful, but I believe those are the people that have the answers and maybe they're not courageous or they're afraid to step forward, but I believe with programs like this, it might give them an opportunity to speak. And if any of these mayors or government officials are smart, they should start listening. From the middle school child up into the seniors that are also being ignored. So, that's my two cents. So I really hope Boston changes. Between the pandemic and the murder of George Floyd, these are big wake-up calls and from this point forward there's no excuse for us to make, not only Boston, but the rest of the United States, just a better place and set an example globally.",

In terms of that, I think that in Boston, there's like a very covert racism in terms of over racism in terms of other places in the US and it's like a cover-up in terms of like how things are running in Boston specifically in Massachusetts. Our prime example is the Boston Public School system. I teach in the BPS system. I've been teaching for seven years. I used to be a teacher at a charter school, and now I'm in the BPS system. And I see the big difference in terms of just how schools are run differently and given that BPS is the oldest institution within the United States and also, the biggest public school system within Massachusetts. I definitely see that resources are not being allocated to students and students are being greatly affected and that's not seen in different parts of Massachusetts. And then, when you look at the demographics within BPS and other school systems within Massachusetts, we see that BPS is predominantly students of color. So my question would be, why is this still happening in 2021? Racism is not something that has vanished, so I know why it's happening but also like why is it happening? But it's just I guess like a rhetorical question, like why is it happening and why aren't we fixing it as a city, as a community, to make sure that students in places that are far out Massachusetts are getting the same instructions, the same love, and the same attention, the same push in Boston that they're doing in Massachusetts? I mean how I arrived to this question is just being an educator and just also being a product of the Boston Public School system, graduating and also teaching in the BPS system and teaching different systems and seeing the big difference in terms of like potential for students and how they could get to where they're supposed to be.",

In terms of that, I think that in Boston, there's like a very covert racism in terms of over racism in terms of other places in the US and it's like a cover-up in terms of like how things are running in Boston specifically in Massachusetts. Our prime example is the Boston Public School system. I teach in the BPS system. I've been teaching for seven years. I used to be a teacher at a charter school, and now I'm in the BPS system. And I see the big difference in terms of just how schools are run differently and given that BPS is the oldest institution within the United States and also, the biggest public school system within Massachusetts. I definitely see that resources are not being allocated to students and students are being greatly affected and that's not seen in different parts of Massachusetts. And then, when you look at the demographics within BPS and other school systems within Massachusetts, we see that BPS is predominantly students of color. So my question would be, why is this still happening in 2021? Racism is not something that has vanished, so I know why it's happening but also like why is it happening? But it's just I guess like a rhetorical question, like why is it happening and why aren't we fixing it as a city, as a community, to make sure that students in places that are far out Massachusetts are getting the same instructions, the same love, and the same attention, the same push in Boston that they're doing in Massachusetts? I mean how I arrived to this question is just being an educator and just also being a product of the Boston Public School system, graduating and also teaching in the BPS system and teaching different systems and seeing the big difference in terms of like potential for students and how they could get to where they're supposed to be.",

In terms of that, I think that in Boston, there's like a very covert racism in terms of over racism in terms of other places in the US and it's like a cover-up in terms of like how things are running in Boston specifically in Massachusetts. Our prime example is the Boston Public School system. I teach in the BPS system. I've been teaching for seven years. I used to be a teacher at a charter school, and now I'm in the BPS system. And I see the big difference in terms of just how schools are run differently and given that BPS is the oldest institution within the United States and also, the biggest public school system within Massachusetts. I definitely see that resources are not being allocated to students and students are being greatly affected and that's not seen in different parts of Massachusetts. And then, when you look at the demographics within BPS and other school systems within Massachusetts, we see that BPS is predominantly students of color. So my question would be, why is this still happening in 2021? Racism is not something that has vanished, so I know why it's happening but also like why is it happening? But it's just I guess like a rhetorical question, like why is it happening and why aren't we fixing it as a city, as a community, to make sure that students in places that are far out Massachusetts are getting the same instructions, the same love, and the same attention, the same push in Boston that they're doing in Massachusetts? I mean how I arrived to this question is just being an educator and just also being a product of the Boston Public School system, graduating and also teaching in the BPS system and teaching different systems and seeing the big difference in terms of like potential for students and how they could get to where they're supposed to be.",

In terms of that, I think that in Boston, there's like a very covert racism in terms of over racism in terms of other places in the US and it's like a cover-up in terms of like how things are running in Boston specifically in Massachusetts. Our prime example is the Boston Public School system. I teach in the BPS system. I've been teaching for seven years. I used to be a teacher at a charter school, and now I'm in the BPS system. And I see the big difference in terms of just how schools are run differently and given that BPS is the oldest institution within the United States and also, the biggest public school system within Massachusetts. I definitely see that resources are not being allocated to students and students are being greatly affected and that's not seen in different parts of Massachusetts. And then, when you look at the demographics within BPS and other school systems within Massachusetts, we see that BPS is predominantly students of color. So my question would be, why is this still happening in 2021? Racism is not something that has vanished, so I know why it's happening but also like why is it happening? But it's just I guess like a rhetorical question, like why is it happening and why aren't we fixing it as a city, as a community, to make sure that students in places that are far out Massachusetts are getting the same instructions, the same love, and the same attention, the same push in Boston that they're doing in Massachusetts? I mean how I arrived to this question is just being an educator and just also being a product of the Boston Public School system, graduating and also teaching in the BPS system and teaching different systems and seeing the big difference in terms of like potential for students and how they could get to where they're supposed to be.",

In terms of that, I think that in Boston, there's like a very covert racism in terms of over racism in terms of other places in the US and it's like a cover-up in terms of like how things are running in Boston specifically in Massachusetts. Our prime example is the Boston Public School system. I teach in the BPS system. I've been teaching for seven years. I used to be a teacher at a charter school, and now I'm in the BPS system. And I see the big difference in terms of just how schools are run differently and given that BPS is the oldest institution within the United States and also, the biggest public school system within Massachusetts. I definitely see that resources are not being allocated to students and students are being greatly affected and that's not seen in different parts of Massachusetts. And then, when you look at the demographics within BPS and other school systems within Massachusetts, we see that BPS is predominantly students of color. So my question would be, why is this still happening in 2021? Racism is not something that has vanished, so I know why it's happening but also like why is it happening? But it's just I guess like a rhetorical question, like why is it happening and why aren't we fixing it as a city, as a community, to make sure that students in places that are far out Massachusetts are getting the same instructions, the same love, and the same attention, the same push in Boston that they're doing in Massachusetts? I mean how I arrived to this question is just being an educator and just also being a product of the Boston Public School system, graduating and also teaching in the BPS system and teaching different systems and seeing the big difference in terms of like potential for students and how they could get to where they're supposed to be.",

When I first was going to go into BPS, people were like, oh my goodness. Why are you going there? It's so bad. Oh, my goodness. How are you going to survive? And I'm like, no, I graduated from BPS system, I feel a little bit offended because I went to a BPS school and I turned out fine. And I feel like I'm a good contribution to the world. So I want other students to also feel that same thing once they graduate. I understand, not to say I definitely don't agree, but I understand where some of the stuff is coming from based off of just how BPS is run and how certain things, and I'm not trying to like downplay BPS like it's a bad organization, but we definitely have a lot of work to do and I just think that that was my experience of, why not be BPS. Why can't somebody from BPS go to Harvard. Don't downplay BPS, don't downplay the students in BPS. They have so much potential just like students that are in different parts of Massachusetts, whether they're in the suburbs, whether they're in the city, they definitely are capable of the same thing. So I guess that's something that has been playing in my mind over the last few months.",

When I first was going to go into BPS, people were like, oh my goodness. Why are you going there? It's so bad. Oh, my goodness. How are you going to survive? And I'm like, no, I graduated from BPS system, I feel a little bit offended because I went to a BPS school and I turned out fine. And I feel like I'm a good contribution to the world. So I want other students to also feel that same thing once they graduate. I understand, not to say I definitely don't agree, but I understand where some of the stuff is coming from based off of just how BPS is run and how certain things, and I'm not trying to like downplay BPS like it's a bad organization, but we definitely have a lot of work to do and I just think that that was my experience of, why not be BPS. Why can't somebody from BPS go to Harvard. Don't downplay BPS, don't downplay the students in BPS. They have so much potential just like students that are in different parts of Massachusetts, whether they're in the suburbs, whether they're in the city, they definitely are capable of the same thing. So I guess that's something that has been playing in my mind over the last few months.",

When I first was going to go into BPS, people were like, oh my goodness. Why are you going there? It's so bad. Oh, my goodness. How are you going to survive? And I'm like, no, I graduated from BPS system, I feel a little bit offended because I went to a BPS school and I turned out fine. And I feel like I'm a good contribution to the world. So I want other students to also feel that same thing once they graduate. I understand, not to say I definitely don't agree, but I understand where some of the stuff is coming from based off of just how BPS is run and how certain things, and I'm not trying to like downplay BPS like it's a bad organization, but we definitely have a lot of work to do and I just think that that was my experience of, why not be BPS. Why can't somebody from BPS go to Harvard. Don't downplay BPS, don't downplay the students in BPS. They have so much potential just like students that are in different parts of Massachusetts, whether they're in the suburbs, whether they're in the city, they definitely are capable of the same thing. So I guess that's something that has been playing in my mind over the last few months.",
