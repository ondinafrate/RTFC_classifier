Anyway, a couple of years later, in '95 or '96, I was renting in Jamaica Plain, and a friend of mine [Chrissolio] who had become a realtor, who I knew from years ago, told me about this first-time home buyers program that the city ran. That if you went to this class downtown you could get a $2,000 grant or loan that would turn into a grant from the city to buy a home if you were a first-time home buyer. And it was for low-income people, which I wasn't making a lot of money at the time so I qualified. And so, I went through this, got the thing, and I found an apartment, 94 Forest Hills Street, in Jamaica Plain, for $72,000 and was able to buy it through this first-time home buyers thing. I got a grant, I got a special, soft second mortgage through the Mass Affordable Housing Alliance and bought this place. And I lived there for several years. Later, Jessica and I got married, we moved to Arlington, I still own it. That apartment, it's your basic triple decker, tens of thousands of other triple deckers, not the whole building, just one floor, a thousand square feet, two bedrooms and a front room is now assessed by the city at about $500,000. I mean, that's crazy to me. So, how can anyone... I mean, I could never buy that house now, even though I make good money. And my daughter who moved to Phil... She's 48, bought a house in Philadelphia for 200 and something thousand dollars, could never, even though she makes a lot of money with her partner. So, that's my question. And that's my story. I mean, I was able to do it because I'm old, I'm 74, in '95/'96 I could buy this place with 72,000 and maybe by inflation, it might be 150 if normal inflation would take place, but it's 500.

It marginalized people of color, it marginalized women, marginalized LGBTQ, all that youth. And I think education is a source of all opportunity and all growth and all wealth. So I speak from my experience, because I had the opportunity to sit in a meeting with Arne Duncan, who is the former Secretary of Education. And this was a meeting where students from all across the country, we sat down, we talked with him. And we just got to talk, what is our education system looking like? And I'm from Boston, Harvard's down the sheet, Wentworth, MIT, all these schools. But in my mind, and I'm actually talking with the kids that I work with now, they're juniors and seniors [inaudible] O' Bryant School. And they're like, they read these books that like, ""The next day, we don't remember what we read."" And it's interesting because I think that when I actually talked with Arnie Duncan, I told him straight up, I was like, ""You look like you're really outstanding man. So why is it that we don't have classes on financing? Why can't we teach cooking class? Why can we teach home economic classes? Why can we not teach our youth how to make a garden? How to cook for yourself? How to buy a car? How to do these things? Why does our family members have to do this on our own and teach and teach us when."" I feel it makes sense in education system, we should be learning that specific fact. I mean, the weather cycle is great and all, but teach the foundations of life first and then you can proceed to electives as in like, language and... I mean, language is of course important but teach stuff on first. And it's interesting because I think that that's something education is once we're going to do it, you have to be a public school, or a private school, or a charter school to start your own curriculum. But I think that it's important to start teaching, especially Black and Brown youth, we shouldn't wait until you're in your 20s to start learning about finance. And it's unfortunate that these kids we had to learn on our own, how to do all of it. It's just not right.",Benedict,*type of highlight.experience,

And it's interesting because I think that when I actually talked with Arnie Duncan, I told him straight up, I was like, ""You look like you're really outstanding man. So why is it that we don't have classes on financing? Why can't we teach cooking class? Why can we teach home economic classes? Why can we not teach our youth how to make a garden?

And I feel we see a lot of buildings and affordable housing units and all these things being pop up, but the demand for is still not being met. So my personal experience is I entered the lottery for one of these new buildings, and the lotteries through the city, but then once you get accepted, it then gets pushed to the property management company. And the property management companies have tactics in place to deter folks from actually being placed within those units. So what accountability measures are being placed for a program that's being funded by the taxpayers, that's being built by the city, and all these different things, and it's just like the ball is passed to folks that are not managing it appropriately. And in a space where there's a lot of just disorganization, and they're not being honest about things. And they're saying, ""Oh, this person's rejecting it, and not creating a full picture."" We're never going to be able to meet the demand. If the folks that you were doing business with, you're not making it clear to them that this is your expectation. And if you don't meet the expectation, the result is you will no longer have a contract as a property management company. And I feel just all around, there's just no accountability period for anyone. Folks just get to do what they want to do, they put a really great picture on, they write eloquent words, they create this whole pie chart and graphs without actually implementing any other measures or showing all the progress that was made. And no one goes back and says, ""Well, we know we want to be able to audit your paperwork, we want to be able to see what it is that you're doing.

My question is, how do I help connect these people that I know who are progressives and care about this, but who somehow, I feel like there's a gap in there, in how they think it needs to be addressed, and they don't quite see the gross inequity. How do I talk to them, educate them, involve them more in what I think is something they care about but maybe aren't seeing the whole picture? Hopefully, it's not just me thinking they should think the way I think, but, so, yeah, that's my question, because I see what seems like a disconnect, and a gap in advocacy and activism around inequitable land use.","Francesca, Erica",economic opportunity.systemic inequality,

I have family members who are undocumented and friends who I know who are undocumented, yet they've lived in the United States for so long, but there is no reform towards helping them to get from wherever they are to a pathway to citizenship, despite living in the US for so long. So really understanding what the reform is present. And again, like this is bigger than Boston, it's definitely on a national scale, where there's just a lot of loopholes that people have to jump through in order to just prove that they deserve to be in the country or prove that they deserve a citizenship, whatever that might be. But really understanding the reform that is being implemented within the city of Boston.",Ivy,*identity of others.foreign-born status,

And the credit score and everything was changing where I did have a decent credit score, but everything was changing. There was a lull for like two or three years where it didn't seem like anyone could buy anything. You know what I'm saying? With the whole watching ... Like I said, with watching housing change where there were housing being sold, three family homes, like I live in Dorchester. For instance, living here in Dorchester versus someone who may live in Roxbury where they started talking about the word regentrification. To be on this side of how everyone had to highlight on Roxbury, I'm one of the people who living here in this community would say that Dorchester is being regentrified, and no one was paying attention to that because like I said the three family homes were being sold, but they're being sold and they're being turned into condos, and how do you turn a three family home and all of a sudden start saying that these are condo floors, and each floor now costs $360,000 versus a home, that whole home would run you $500,000. You know what I'm saying? I personally witnessed that. That's where my question comes from with the formula in pricing based of ... Where I think the housing crash happened, it took away, I think, the American dream of a hard working person owning a home and being able to own a home and say possibly use one of their floors to be their small business or like I said a second income. That's what I've seen with the what happened to housing since 2008, and the way that is continuing. That's a part of the whole plan of where she says the whole plan of before was what was Boston going to look like in 2020, and now the whole vision is 2030, and just that part like where is rent going to go from here if an average three bedroom apartment if you can get it to say apartment and not condo is running like $2,200, $2,300 and more. There's something a lot of people who have decent jobs that work for the T, that work for the police, I work for the city, one of the city department divisions, and that's astronomical to be asking somebody to spend $2,000 a month.

I've been working in one regard, the other with young people for the last 10 years and just doing life with them, spending time with them, mentoring, hanging out, just seeing this consistent theme of young people, especially brown and black young people, not feeling like they have anywhere to go when stuff is going wrong around them. And when they're facing a trial or something, or trauma or whatever it may be. So many times it's either they turn to their peers or they're keeping it in, or unfortunately, turn into other things to try and fill that void. And so I spent a lot of time working with young people in the context of the church. And so, a lot of it is spiritual-based, but as I grew older, I just really felt this need of, ""We can do more for these young people, than have them for two hours at a church service on a Friday night."" And so for me, it was just very looking for, ""How do I find a holistic way to be of service to young people, to see them get access to more than just mental health resources, but healthier food, education?"" And even this past summer, I encountered so many kids who just legitimately so intelligent, so smart. Even more than me, but [inaudible] for them, they don't want to go to school, they don't want to take classes, but it's so... Just tension of seeing the brilliance in them, that the things that they're passionate about, they're so gifted in, but then just having no desire to apply to the certain areas in school, or you even just like... Sometimes high school is just the end. They're like, ""Let me just... I'll finish high school and then whatever happens, happens."" And oftentimes there's not this... They don't often see that path or that way forward. And I think Shamika, you mentioned something earlier about, or maybe I can't remember it was [inaudible], helping these kids finding that hope again. And so being able to say, ""Hey, there is actually a path forward for me to success."" And, yes, if that's [inaudible], but success doesn't have to be limited to getting a bachelor's. Especially in 2021, there are so many different ways that you can find success and make money and be happy and achieve all those goals. So it's really trying to find ways that these teens can actually envision a future. And it did surprise me this summer by hearing just how many of our teens didn't have that plan or even have that thought. And so hoping that in these conversations, and as we elevate more voices and elevate more youth voices, that we can start to bring back some of those things and some of those programs that show our kids and show our community in general, that there is a path forward, there is a way forward. And so that's just really where I'm at and how I've gotten here.",David,*identity of others.age,

We used to go into Lower Allston or even Little Italy or even North End, and those kind of areas, you don't really see any of these operators or even businesses in that area. So to say, there is a restriction between Boston and Natives and then coming back to Bruce's ideal is why can't we not all live in peace, but for understanding is the reason why we can't leave in peace because we live under different tax brackets. So as me, I'm a Roxbury native. I could go as far as South End and feel included because there's many Latinos living there. But as a Roxbury native, when I was working in Cambridge, I felt excluded. I felt like I wasn't a part of that neighborhood, even though that neighborhood is, it's two cities in one. So it's very difficult to say or to view that. Okay, I'm from Boston, I'm from the bean, I'm a Red Sox fan. I'm the official patriarch. There's things of that nature, where we are all implemented in, but at the same time, we can't just all cross each other's regions. So my thing is when is it that it's going to be acceptable as me as a Roxbury native, that I'm accepted in Downtown Boston? Now it's very hard because I know the city has different on plans where they're putting in new housings, they're putting in new programs that doesn't really abide by Boston residential people. It only abides by people outside of the city or the ones that are coming in because Boston is technically known as the hub. So being the hub, that means we're bringing in different businesses from all over the world. So being that means we're bringing in different businesses from all over the world. And a couple years ago, we was known as the number one city in the country. So my thing is, when is it that the people from our city are going to be accepted in our city? Because we're the ones who make Boston real. We're the ones who make it, the way it is, the persona of being a Bostonian, is not these out of state people. That's my difficulty of understanding. Are we really going to be fully accepted or are we not? And that's the end of mine.",William,*identity of others.race-ethnicity,
