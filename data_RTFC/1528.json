And for me just being a recent graduate for mental health counseling, I see myself in the community working with different organizations or agencies, trying to rid the stigma of having a mental health disorder or issues. I see that is a concern from the pandemic as well, where people were quarantined and people are usually on the go and commuting and the hustle and bustle and the connection with people in your office or wherever you went from day to day. So I see the present health concern of mental health and the stability of its Boston residents, that it should be brought to the forefront of the table, because if we can't start from within ourselves, how can we build community? How can we keep the neighborhoods together? How can we unify? It's like they really have to take notice that this is something that has to be put on the agenda or the program, or however the candidates are leading to press Boston residents. This has to be up in the top five.",

And for me just being a recent graduate for mental health counseling, I see myself in the community working with different organizations or agencies, trying to rid the stigma of having a mental health disorder or issues. I see that is a concern from the pandemic as well, where people were quarantined and people are usually on the go and commuting and the hustle and bustle and the connection with people in your office or wherever you went from day to day. So I see the present health concern of mental health and the stability of its Boston residents, that it should be brought to the forefront of the table, because if we can't start from within ourselves, how can we build community? How can we keep the neighborhoods together? How can we unify? It's like they really have to take notice that this is something that has to be put on the agenda or the program, or however the candidates are leading to press Boston residents. This has to be up in the top five.",

And for me just being a recent graduate for mental health counseling, I see myself in the community working with different organizations or agencies, trying to rid the stigma of having a mental health disorder or issues. I see that is a concern from the pandemic as well, where people were quarantined and people are usually on the go and commuting and the hustle and bustle and the connection with people in your office or wherever you went from day to day. So I see the present health concern of mental health and the stability of its Boston residents, that it should be brought to the forefront of the table, because if we can't start from within ourselves, how can we build community? How can we keep the neighborhoods together? How can we unify? It's like they really have to take notice that this is something that has to be put on the agenda or the program, or however the candidates are leading to press Boston residents. This has to be up in the top five.",

It's like, it's really there, but why was that always frowned upon that this is the buildup that's going to burst as to why nothing got done about it, or people didn't know how to speak to their physicians or just bring it out. It was like, what happens in the house stays in the house. Mm. And that's not always a good way to rear children or young youth, because it's like, \"All right, so what do I tell? What do I not? But I still need this help.\" So it's, I don't know, it's always been so confusing, but when it happened for my child, I made sure to do everything that I could. And even though I wasn't an advocate for mental health at that time, I knew that it was something that was real. Even though I don't like the way that it was brought up from the school system, because sometimes people don't have of empathy for ways that they deliver messages. So it was kind of, you get on the defense first, before you really accept what was being said about your child or what they noticed. Right. So that needs to be taken account of, like a revamp for those resources in the school to get them some kind of training as well when they deliver those kind of messages to parents about their observance of their student or that person's child. But yeah, so mental health is still really a big forefront because if you don't have sense of self, everything around you is going to always be in pieces. Hm. Okay. So you start in there to get those pieces together so that you can have the coping skills, you can have mechanisms that you can reach for and resources for people that you can reach out to. So, that's my main concern. And to piggyback off with Ms. Carol, the crime is really getting ridiculous. I sat here the other night, and I did hear that those 25 shots that that person got dumped in the other day up on Walk Hill. And I could sit... I was sitting on the couch and I heard each shot and I said, \"Oh my goodness.\" I didn't know where it came from, but to find out that it came from Walk Hill, that's still a distance from me. Like how did I hear that?",

And for that, for myself, I've never been diagnosed with it, but I know firsthand just by looking all around that our people need help. Even starting from within my own household, even starting from within the family, like I've noticed so much from doing all the readings and the research and all that. It's like, it's really there, but why was that always frowned upon that this is the buildup that's going to burst as to why nothing got done about it, or people didn't know how to speak to their physicians or just bring it out. It was like, what happens in the house stays in the house. Mm. And that's not always a good way to rear children or young youth, because it's like, \"All right, so what do I tell? What do I not? But I still need this help.\" So it's, I don't know, it's always been so confusing, but when it happened for my child, I made sure to do everything that I could. And even though I wasn't an advocate for mental health at that time, I knew that it was something that was real. Even though I don't like the way that it was brought up from the school system, because sometimes people don't have of empathy for ways that they deliver messages. So it was kind of, you get on the defense first, before you really accept what was being said about your child or what they noticed. Right. So that needs to be taken account of, like a revamp for those resources in the school to get them some kind of training as well when they deliver those kind of messages to parents about their observance of their student or that person's child. But yeah, so mental health is still really a big forefront because if you don't have sense of self, everything around you is going to always be in pieces. Hm. Okay. So you start in there to get those pieces together so that you can have the coping skills, you can have mechanisms that you can reach for and resources for people that you can reach out to. So, that's my main concern. And to piggyback off with Ms. Carol, the crime is really getting ridiculous. I sat here the other night, and I did hear that those 25 shots that that person got dumped in the other day up on Walk Hill. And I could sit... I was sitting on the couch and I heard each shot and I said, \"Oh my goodness.\" I didn't know where it came from, but to find out that it came from Walk Hill, that's still a distance from me. Like how did I hear that?",

But I still need this help.\" So it's, I don't know, it's always been so confusing, but when it happened for my child, I made sure to do everything that I could. And even though I wasn't an advocate for mental health at that time, I knew that it was something that was real. Even though I don't like the way that it was brought up from the school system, because sometimes people don't have of empathy for ways that they deliver messages. So it was kind of, you get on the defense first, before you really accept what was being said about your child or what they noticed. Right. So that needs to be taken account of, like a revamp for those resources in the school to get them some kind of training as well when they deliver those kind of messages to parents about their observance of their student or that person's child. But yeah, so mental health is still really a big forefront because if you don't have sense of self, everything around you is going to always be in pieces. Hm. Okay. So you start in there to get those pieces together so that you can have the coping skills, you can have mechanisms that you can reach for and resources for people that you can reach out to. So, that's my main concern. And to piggyback off with Ms. Carol, the crime is really getting ridiculous. I sat here the other night, and I did hear that those 25 shots that that person got dumped in the other day up on Walk Hill. And I could sit... I was sitting on the couch and I heard each shot and I said, \"Oh my goodness.\" I didn't know where it came from, but to find out that it came from Walk Hill, that's still a distance from me. Like how did I hear that?",

And for that, for myself, I've never been diagnosed with it, but I know firsthand just by looking all around that our people need help. Even starting from within my own household, even starting from within the family, like I've noticed so much from doing all the readings and the research and all that. It's like, it's really there, but why was that always frowned upon that this is the buildup that's going to burst as to why nothing got done about it, or people didn't know how to speak to their physicians or just bring it out. It was like, what happens in the house stays in the house. Mm. And that's not always a good way to rear children or young youth, because it's like, \"All right, so what do I tell? What do I not? But I still need this help.\" So it's, I don't know, it's always been so confusing, but when it happened for my child, I made sure to do everything that I could. And even though I wasn't an advocate for mental health at that time, I knew that it was something that was real. Even though I don't like the way that it was brought up from the school system, because sometimes people don't have of empathy for ways that they deliver messages. So it was kind of, you get on the defense first, before you really accept what was being said about your child or what they noticed. Right. So that needs to be taken account of, like a revamp for those resources in the school to get them some kind of training as well when they deliver those kind of messages to parents about their observance of their student or that person's child. But yeah, so mental health is still really a big forefront because if you don't have sense of self, everything around you is going to always be in pieces. Hm. Okay. So you start in there to get those pieces together so that you can have the coping skills, you can have mechanisms that you can reach for and resources for people that you can reach out to. So, that's my main concern. And to piggyback off with Ms. Carol, the crime is really getting ridiculous. I sat here the other night, and I did hear that those 25 shots that that person got dumped in the other day up on Walk Hill. And I could sit... I was sitting on the couch and I heard each shot and I said, \"Oh my goodness.\" I didn't know where it came from, but to find out that it came from Walk Hill, that's still a distance from me. Like how did I hear that?",

So you start in there to get those pieces together so that you can have the coping skills, you can have mechanisms that you can reach for and resources for people that you can reach out to. So, that's my main concern. And to piggyback off with Ms. Carol, the crime is really getting ridiculous. I sat here the other night, and I did hear that those 25 shots that that person got dumped in the other day up on Walk Hill. And I could sit...

And for that, for myself, I've never been diagnosed with it, but I know firsthand just by looking all around that our people need help. Even starting from within my own household, even starting from within the family, like I've noticed so much from doing all the readings and the research and all that. It's like, it's really there, but why was that always frowned upon that this is the buildup that's going to burst as to why nothing got done about it, or people didn't know how to speak to their physicians or just bring it out. It was like, what happens in the house stays in the house. Mm. And that's not always a good way to rear children or young youth, because it's like, \"All right, so what do I tell? What do I not? But I still need this help.\" So it's, I don't know, it's always been so confusing, but when it happened for my child, I made sure to do everything that I could. And even though I wasn't an advocate for mental health at that time, I knew that it was something that was real. Even though I don't like the way that it was brought up from the school system, because sometimes people don't have of empathy for ways that they deliver messages. So it was kind of, you get on the defense first, before you really accept what was being said about your child or what they noticed. Right. So that needs to be taken account of, like a revamp for those resources in the school to get them some kind of training as well when they deliver those kind of messages to parents about their observance of their student or that person's child. But yeah, so mental health is still really a big forefront because if you don't have sense of self, everything around you is going to always be in pieces. Hm. Okay. So you start in there to get those pieces together so that you can have the coping skills, you can have mechanisms that you can reach for and resources for people that you can reach out to. So, that's my main concern. And to piggyback off with Ms. Carol, the crime is really getting ridiculous. I sat here the other night, and I did hear that those 25 shots that that person got dumped in the other day up on Walk Hill. And I could sit... I was sitting on the couch and I heard each shot and I said, \"Oh my goodness.\" I didn't know where it came from, but to find out that it came from Walk Hill, that's still a distance from me. Like how did I hear that?",

And for that, for myself, I've never been diagnosed with it, but I know firsthand just by looking all around that our people need help. Even starting from within my own household, even starting from within the family, like I've noticed so much from doing all the readings and the research and all that. It's like, it's really there, but why was that always frowned upon that this is the buildup that's going to burst as to why nothing got done about it, or people didn't know how to speak to their physicians or just bring it out. It was like, what happens in the house stays in the house. Mm. And that's not always a good way to rear children or young youth, because it's like, \"All right, so what do I tell? What do I not? But I still need this help.\" So it's, I don't know, it's always been so confusing, but when it happened for my child, I made sure to do everything that I could.

And for that, for myself, I've never been diagnosed with it, but I know firsthand just by looking all around that our people need help. Even starting from within my own household, even starting from within the family, like I've noticed so much from doing all the readings and the research and all that. It's like, it's really there, but why was that always frowned upon that this is the buildup that's going to burst as to why nothing got done about it, or people didn't know how to speak to their physicians or just bring it out. It was like, what happens in the house stays in the house. Mm. And that's not always a good way to rear children or young youth, because it's like, \"All right, so what do I tell? What do I not? But I still need this help.\" So it's, I don't know, it's always been so confusing, but when it happened for my child, I made sure to do everything that I could. And even though I wasn't an advocate for mental health at that time, I knew that it was something that was real. Even though I don't like the way that it was brought up from the school system, because sometimes people don't have of empathy for ways that they deliver messages. So it was kind of, you get on the defense first, before you really accept what was being said about your child or what they noticed. Right. So that needs to be taken account of, like a revamp for those resources in the school to get them some kind of training as well when they deliver those kind of messages to parents about their observance of their student or that person's child. But yeah, so mental health is still really a big forefront because if you don't have sense of self, everything around you is going to always be in pieces. Hm. Okay. So you start in there to get those pieces together so that you can have the coping skills, you can have mechanisms that you can reach for and resources for people that you can reach out to. So, that's my main concern. And to piggyback off with Ms. Carol, the crime is really getting ridiculous. I sat here the other night, and I did hear that those 25 shots that that person got dumped in the other day up on Walk Hill. And I could sit... I was sitting on the couch and I heard each shot and I said, \"Oh my goodness.\" I didn't know where it came from, but to find out that it came from Walk Hill, that's still a distance from me. Like how did I hear that?",

And for that, for myself, I've never been diagnosed with it, but I know firsthand just by looking all around that our people need help. Even starting from within my own household, even starting from within the family, like I've noticed so much from doing all the readings and the research and all that. It's like, it's really there, but why was that always frowned upon that this is the buildup that's going to burst as to why nothing got done about it, or people didn't know how to speak to their physicians or just bring it out. It was like, what happens in the house stays in the house. Mm. And that's not always a good way to rear children or young youth, because it's like, \"All right, so what do I tell? What do I not? But I still need this help.\" So it's, I don't know, it's always been so confusing, but when it happened for my child, I made sure to do everything that I could. And even though I wasn't an advocate for mental health at that time, I knew that it was something that was real. Even though I don't like the way that it was brought up from the school system, because sometimes people don't have of empathy for ways that they deliver messages. So it was kind of, you get on the defense first, before you really accept what was being said about your child or what they noticed. Right. So that needs to be taken account of, like a revamp for those resources in the school to get them some kind of training as well when they deliver those kind of messages to parents about their observance of their student or that person's child. But yeah, so mental health is still really a big forefront because if you don't have sense of self, everything around you is going to always be in pieces. Hm. Okay. So you start in there to get those pieces together so that you can have the coping skills, you can have mechanisms that you can reach for and resources for people that you can reach out to. So, that's my main concern. And to piggyback off with Ms. Carol, the crime is really getting ridiculous. I sat here the other night, and I did hear that those 25 shots that that person got dumped in the other day up on Walk Hill. And I could sit... I was sitting on the couch and I heard each shot and I said, \"Oh my goodness.\" I didn't know where it came from, but to find out that it came from Walk Hill, that's still a distance from me. Like how did I hear that?",

Like just a different child, like, \"I don't even know who you are and you're here every day\" type thing. And then also for me, also the social interaction, which I feel like I lost out on before the pandemic, because I had a baby and just stuff was changing. And not having access to specific resources to help myself move forward because people just go to work and go to work and just go to work. But when you're unhappy and you go to work, you don't want to go to work because I don't want to do that. That's not something that I want to do, so I don't want to go there. So then that was a depression, I fell into a very deep, dark depression because of that, because I knew that that's not what I want to do. You know? Like this is, \"I don't want to do this. I don't want to go there. I don't want to talk to these people. I don't want to look at them. I don't want to see them,\" and I became very closed off. And then I'm trying to insert myself back into the regular world, and I see that it's not normal, it's not regular. People are just not the same. And it, to me, I don't think it ever will be. And I feel like the resources are very minimum, and... yeah.",

Like just a different child, like, \"I don't even know who you are and you're here every day\" type thing. And then also for me, also the social interaction, which I feel like I lost out on before the pandemic, because I had a baby and just stuff was changing. And not having access to specific resources to help myself move forward because people just go to work and go to work and just go to work. But when you're unhappy and you go to work, you don't want to go to work because I don't want to do that. That's not something that I want to do, so I don't want to go there. So then that was a depression, I fell into a very deep, dark depression because of that, because I knew that that's not what I want to do. You know? Like this is, \"I don't want to do this. I don't want to go there. I don't want to talk to these people. I don't want to look at them. I don't want to see them,\" and I became very closed off. And then I'm trying to insert myself back into the regular world, and I see that it's not normal, it's not regular. People are just not the same. And it, to me, I don't think it ever will be. And I feel like the resources are very minimum, and... yeah.",

Like just a different child, like, \"I don't even know who you are and you're here every day\" type thing. And then also for me, also the social interaction, which I feel like I lost out on before the pandemic, because I had a baby and just stuff was changing. And not having access to specific resources to help myself move forward because people just go to work and go to work and just go to work. But when you're unhappy and you go to work, you don't want to go to work because I don't want to do that. That's not something that I want to do, so I don't want to go there. So then that was a depression, I fell into a very deep, dark depression because of that, because I knew that that's not what I want to do. You know? Like this is, \"I don't want to do this. I don't want to go there. I don't want to talk to these people. I don't want to look at them. I don't want to see them,\" and I became very closed off. And then I'm trying to insert myself back into the regular world, and I see that it's not normal, it's not regular. People are just not the same. And it, to me, I don't think it ever will be. And I feel like the resources are very minimum, and... yeah.",

Like just a different child, like, \"I don't even know who you are and you're here every day\" type thing. And then also for me, also the social interaction, which I feel like I lost out on before the pandemic, because I had a baby and just stuff was changing. And not having access to specific resources to help myself move forward because people just go to work and go to work and just go to work. But when you're unhappy and you go to work, you don't want to go to work because I don't want to do that. That's not something that I want to do, so I don't want to go there. So then that was a depression, I fell into a very deep, dark depression because of that, because I knew that that's not what I want to do. You know? Like this is, \"I don't want to do this. I don't want to go there. I don't want to talk to these people. I don't want to look at them. I don't want to see them,\" and I became very closed off. And then I'm trying to insert myself back into the regular world, and I see that it's not normal, it's not regular. People are just not the same. And it, to me, I don't think it ever will be. And I feel like the resources are very minimum, and... yeah.",

I raised a son with special needs. And during this pandemic, my son is now 27 years old. And the services that has not been provided for him through this pandemic is not in void. There has not been any services for him, and it is very shameful of the city of Boston that I'm just heartbroken right now that the city of Boston has neglected special needs, mental health. I'm just overwhelmed with the services that have not been provided. They are very slow and adamant about getting the services out for these people that have special needs, even the handicap special needs people. I'm overwhelmed with what they needed to be, what needs to be done with that. That's where I'm at with that. That's what needs to be done with that. Yeah. So, yeah. But that's where I'm at with that. I don't even know where to go else with it, but the special needs, mental health issue, my family, families that are out there with the... that's where I'm going with that.",

I raised a son with special needs. And during this pandemic, my son is now 27 years old. And the services that has not been provided for him through this pandemic is not in void. There has not been any services for him, and it is very shameful of the city of Boston that I'm just heartbroken right now that the city of Boston has neglected special needs, mental health. I'm just overwhelmed with the services that have not been provided. They are very slow and adamant about getting the services out for these people that have special needs, even the handicap special needs people. I'm overwhelmed with what they needed to be, what needs to be done with that. That's where I'm at with that. That's what needs to be done with that. Yeah. So, yeah. But that's where I'm at with that. I don't even know where to go else with it, but the special needs, mental health issue, my family, families that are out there with the... that's where I'm going with that.",
