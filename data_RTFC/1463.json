Maybe they were sponsored by their government, and they were well-trained. But I worked with them in computer schools, and a lot of them, they have a lot of skills. Yeah, I say to myself, thinking that if I can put together a computer network, physical computer network, and have a nonprofit organization, I might invite in US citizens that are striving to develop their skills in the IT department, and come in and work at it to try to gain those skills, because the knowledge they're getting in colleges, like the community college, I guess isn't enough. You're not allowed to take the computers apart, work with it, experiment. They only let you do a certain level of configuration, but that's it. When you go out into the real world, it's a lot different. It's a lot, lot different. You won't understand Excel. Okay, I've got two certificates from Excel at a really good IT school, and in Excel, they got us to do a couple of links to a couple of pages, do a couple of formulas, and that was about it, where you can go in and enter the information in this page, and the information will appear in the next page. You might type a form in MS Word, and then embed the information from Excel to that Word form, and that was it. I mean, it looked great. It was fantastic to learn it. But when I got into the work environment and I got handed a Excel document, it's a good thing I was strong with Excel, because that Excel document had about 500 different lines that I had to go through looking to do that entry and the make sure that there was no mistakes in the other part of the balance sheet, another page on the Excel. And if it did, I had to find where the mistake was. That was a big difference. In the community college, it was just two links to two pages, but in the real world, it was a huge [crosstalk]. Okay. Okay. So, like that, the same way it is with IT. You look at a few computers, but the computers are... You cannot put them together or take them apart completely. They stare. You do a couple of things, and voila. You know, you're not... Yeah. Okay. So, you have... Okay. All right. So, I get it. You're talking about the differences in level of training- Right. ... and [crosstalk]. And that skill level between foreign technicians and US technicians.",

Maybe they were sponsored by their government, and they were well-trained. But I worked with them in computer schools, and a lot of them, they have a lot of skills. Yeah, I say to myself, thinking that if I can put together a computer network, physical computer network, and have a nonprofit organization, I might invite in US citizens that are striving to develop their skills in the IT department, and come in and work at it to try to gain those skills, because the knowledge they're getting in colleges, like the community college, I guess isn't enough. You're not allowed to take the computers apart, work with it, experiment. They only let you do a certain level of configuration, but that's it. When you go out into the real world, it's a lot different. It's a lot, lot different. You won't understand Excel. Okay, I've got two certificates from Excel at a really good IT school, and in Excel, they got us to do a couple of links to a couple of pages, do a couple of formulas, and that was about it, where you can go in and enter the information in this page, and the information will appear in the next page. You might type a form in MS Word, and then embed the information from Excel to that Word form, and that was it. I mean, it looked great. It was fantastic to learn it. But when I got into the work environment and I got handed a Excel document, it's a good thing I was strong with Excel, because that Excel document had about 500 different lines that I had to go through looking to do that entry and the make sure that there was no mistakes in the other part of the balance sheet, another page on the Excel. And if it did, I had to find where the mistake was. That was a big difference. In the community college, it was just two links to two pages, but in the real world, it was a huge [crosstalk]. Okay. Okay. So, like that, the same way it is with IT. You look at a few computers, but the computers are... You cannot put them together or take them apart completely. They stare. You do a couple of things, and voila. You know, you're not... Yeah. Okay. So, you have... Okay. All right. So, I get it. You're talking about the differences in level of training- Right. ... and [crosstalk]. And that skill level between foreign technicians and US technicians.",

Maybe they were sponsored by their government, and they were well-trained. But I worked with them in computer schools, and a lot of them, they have a lot of skills. Yeah, I say to myself, thinking that if I can put together a computer network, physical computer network, and have a nonprofit organization, I might invite in US citizens that are striving to develop their skills in the IT department, and come in and work at it to try to gain those skills, because the knowledge they're getting in colleges, like the community college, I guess isn't enough. You're not allowed to take the computers apart, work with it, experiment. They only let you do a certain level of configuration, but that's it. When you go out into the real world, it's a lot different. It's a lot, lot different. You won't understand Excel. Okay, I've got two certificates from Excel at a really good IT school, and in Excel, they got us to do a couple of links to a couple of pages, do a couple of formulas, and that was about it, where you can go in and enter the information in this page, and the information will appear in the next page. You might type a form in MS Word, and then embed the information from Excel to that Word form, and that was it. I mean, it looked great. It was fantastic to learn it. But when I got into the work environment and I got handed a Excel document, it's a good thing I was strong with Excel, because that Excel document had about 500 different lines that I had to go through looking to do that entry and the make sure that there was no mistakes in the other part of the balance sheet, another page on the Excel. And if it did, I had to find where the mistake was. That was a big difference. In the community college, it was just two links to two pages, but in the real world, it was a huge [crosstalk]. Okay. Okay. So, like that, the same way it is with IT. You look at a few computers, but the computers are... You cannot put them together or take them apart completely. They stare. You do a couple of things, and voila. You know, you're not... Yeah. Okay. So, you have... Okay. All right. So, I get it. You're talking about the differences in level of training- Right. ... and [crosstalk]. And that skill level between foreign technicians and US technicians.",

Maybe they were sponsored by their government, and they were well-trained. But I worked with them in computer schools, and a lot of them, they have a lot of skills. Yeah, I say to myself, thinking that if I can put together a computer network, physical computer network, and have a nonprofit organization, I might invite in US citizens that are striving to develop their skills in the IT department, and come in and work at it to try to gain those skills, because the knowledge they're getting in colleges, like the community college, I guess isn't enough. You're not allowed to take the computers apart, work with it, experiment. They only let you do a certain level of configuration, but that's it. When you go out into the real world, it's a lot different. It's a lot, lot different. You won't understand Excel. Okay, I've got two certificates from Excel at a really good IT school, and in Excel, they got us to do a couple of links to a couple of pages, do a couple of formulas, and that was about it, where you can go in and enter the information in this page, and the information will appear in the next page. You might type a form in MS Word, and then embed the information from Excel to that Word form, and that was it. I mean, it looked great. It was fantastic to learn it. But when I got into the work environment and I got handed a Excel document, it's a good thing I was strong with Excel, because that Excel document had about 500 different lines that I had to go through looking to do that entry and the make sure that there was no mistakes in the other part of the balance sheet, another page on the Excel. And if it did, I had to find where the mistake was. That was a big difference. In the community college, it was just two links to two pages, but in the real world, it was a huge [crosstalk]. Okay. Okay. So, like that, the same way it is with IT. You look at a few computers, but the computers are... You cannot put them together or take them apart completely. They stare. You do a couple of things, and voila. You know, you're not... Yeah. Okay. So, you have... Okay. All right. So, I get it. You're talking about the differences in level of training- Right. ... and [crosstalk]. And that skill level between foreign technicians and US technicians.",

Maybe they were sponsored by their government, and they were well-trained. But I worked with them in computer schools, and a lot of them, they have a lot of skills. Yeah, I say to myself, thinking that if I can put together a computer network, physical computer network, and have a nonprofit organization, I might invite in US citizens that are striving to develop their skills in the IT department, and come in and work at it to try to gain those skills, because the knowledge they're getting in colleges, like the community college, I guess isn't enough. You're not allowed to take the computers apart, work with it, experiment. They only let you do a certain level of configuration, but that's it. When you go out into the real world, it's a lot different. It's a lot, lot different. You won't understand Excel. Okay, I've got two certificates from Excel at a really good IT school, and in Excel, they got us to do a couple of links to a couple of pages, do a couple of formulas, and that was about it, where you can go in and enter the information in this page, and the information will appear in the next page. You might type a form in MS Word, and then embed the information from Excel to that Word form, and that was it. I mean, it looked great. It was fantastic to learn it. But when I got into the work environment and I got handed a Excel document, it's a good thing I was strong with Excel, because that Excel document had about 500 different lines that I had to go through looking to do that entry and the make sure that there was no mistakes in the other part of the balance sheet, another page on the Excel. And if it did, I had to find where the mistake was. That was a big difference. In the community college, it was just two links to two pages, but in the real world, it was a huge [crosstalk]. Okay. Okay. So, like that, the same way it is with IT. You look at a few computers, but the computers are... You cannot put them together or take them apart completely. They stare. You do a couple of things, and voila. You know, you're not... Yeah. Okay. So, you have... Okay. All right. So, I get it. You're talking about the differences in level of training- Right. ... and [crosstalk]. And that skill level between foreign technicians and US technicians.",

What kind of employment opportunities can we have that will pay the kind of wages that will let me, and others, live in South End, Back Bay, Fenway, Beacon Hill, Seaport, Financial District, even Jamaica Plain? What will happen to the middle class in Boston? Will there be... Because we are getting to be like third-world countries. There's the wealthy, and there are the servants. You cannot successfully hold together a society without a thriving middle class, and the middle class is shrinking, is disappearing in places like Boston, and New York, and San Francisco. Disappearing in places like London and Paris. Disappearing. So, that's my question. What kind of jobs are going to be around to pay more? This so-called living wage thing, $15 an hour, that's after-school money. You know? Okay, that's after-school money. If I compare the wage that I got in a factory job in the '70s at Uniroyal. The minimum wage was like $2.50 an hour. I was marketing like $5.50 an hour. I mean, if I had kept on that wage, I'd probably be making $85,000 a year now. But the unions are gone. I mean, unions are not typically... Well, socially, not middle class, but middle income. But the thing is, that's what I'm thinking about. The bread and butter, \"How you going to make money? How you going to live?\" That's my question. Who is advocating for that?",

What kind of employment opportunities can we have that will pay the kind of wages that will let me, and others, live in South End, Back Bay, Fenway, Beacon Hill, Seaport, Financial District, even Jamaica Plain? What will happen to the middle class in Boston? Will there be... Because we are getting to be like third-world countries. There's the wealthy, and there are the servants. You cannot successfully hold together a society without a thriving middle class, and the middle class is shrinking, is disappearing in places like Boston, and New York, and San Francisco. Disappearing in places like London and Paris. Disappearing. So, that's my question. What kind of jobs are going to be around to pay more? This so-called living wage thing, $15 an hour, that's after-school money. You know? Okay, that's after-school money. If I compare the wage that I got in a factory job in the '70s at Uniroyal. The minimum wage was like $2.50 an hour. I was marketing like $5.50 an hour. I mean, if I had kept on that wage, I'd probably be making $85,000 a year now. But the unions are gone. I mean, unions are not typically... Well, socially, not middle class, but middle income. But the thing is, that's what I'm thinking about. The bread and butter, \"How you going to make money? How you going to live?\" That's my question. Who is advocating for that?",

And I see the people who are affected by the crisis, what they do. I'm not quite sure how I should proceed around this. Definitely, impacts everybody's quality of life. Those individuals need assistance. They need help. What's the answer to it? There can be many answers. I believe there are commissions that are in place right now to develop different strategies to deal with it, but you don't need commissions. You need actions. Do you need a bridge to Long Island? Do you need ferries to Long Island? Is that the answer? Do you need to decentralize facilities in the suburbs? Does the state need to step in and help with that? But anyone who has to walk on the sidewalk and worry about somebody coming up, going in your face, maybe putting their hands on you, because I've had that experience more than once, what are you to think of this? What are you to think of this going forward? Do you want to ride in a subway car with somebody who's passed out with no mask on? Do you want to get off at a subway station, see a group of people. They're there because they have no place to go. What do we do? Are we our brother's keepers? What do we do here? But this is a quality of life and public health issue that affects all of us, both those who need help, as well as everyone who could provide help.",

And I see the people who are affected by the crisis, what they do. I'm not quite sure how I should proceed around this. Definitely, impacts everybody's quality of life. Those individuals need assistance. They need help. What's the answer to it? There can be many answers. I believe there are commissions that are in place right now to develop different strategies to deal with it, but you don't need commissions. You need actions. Do you need a bridge to Long Island? Do you need ferries to Long Island? Is that the answer? Do you need to decentralize facilities in the suburbs? Does the state need to step in and help with that? But anyone who has to walk on the sidewalk and worry about somebody coming up, going in your face, maybe putting their hands on you, because I've had that experience more than once, what are you to think of this? What are you to think of this going forward? Do you want to ride in a subway car with somebody who's passed out with no mask on? Do you want to get off at a subway station, see a group of people. They're there because they have no place to go. What do we do? Are we our brother's keepers? What do we do here? But this is a quality of life and public health issue that affects all of us, both those who need help, as well as everyone who could provide help.",

And I see the people who are affected by the crisis, what they do. I'm not quite sure how I should proceed around this. Definitely, impacts everybody's quality of life. Those individuals need assistance. They need help. What's the answer to it? There can be many answers. I believe there are commissions that are in place right now to develop different strategies to deal with it, but you don't need commissions. You need actions. Do you need a bridge to Long Island? Do you need ferries to Long Island? Is that the answer? Do you need to decentralize facilities in the suburbs? Does the state need to step in and help with that? But anyone who has to walk on the sidewalk and worry about somebody coming up, going in your face, maybe putting their hands on you, because I've had that experience more than once, what are you to think of this? What are you to think of this going forward? Do you want to ride in a subway car with somebody who's passed out with no mask on? Do you want to get off at a subway station, see a group of people. They're there because they have no place to go. What do we do? Are we our brother's keepers? What do we do here? But this is a quality of life and public health issue that affects all of us, both those who need help, as well as everyone who could provide help.",
